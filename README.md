## What is NIBRS and Why Explore This Dataset?

The **National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS)** is a standardized reporting system managed by the FBI for crime response agencies across the United States. Previously, the **SRS** (Self-Reported Crime Data) was used in conjunction with NIBRS, but it was recently replaced with NIBRS as the sole focus to ensure more reliable and high-quality data.

Learning about this transition was particularly intriguing as I encountered both systems in my **CCJS100 - Introduction to Criminal Justice** course. The exploration of NIBRS deepened my understanding of how crime data is systematically documented for such a vast database. The discussion of NIBRS was a crucial part of the class, and working with this data in Tableau made me reflect on the importance of the topics discussed in my studies.
