#What is NIBRS and why explore this dataset?
The National Incident-Based Reporting System is a standardized reporting system within the United States managed by the FBI for all crime response agencies. Previously. The SRS for self-reported crime data was utilized alongside NIBRS and was recently replaced permanently with the sole focus of NIBRS for more data quality and reliability. Learning this was intriguing as I had learned about both systems in one of my favorite Gen Ed classes, CCJS100 Introduction to Criminal Justice. I wanted to explore it further and see the data collected and how it was documented for such a large-scale database. Discussion of NIBRS was a crucial portion of the class so working through the data to plan through my Tableau sheets made me reflect on the magnitude of importance of the topics discussed in my class.
